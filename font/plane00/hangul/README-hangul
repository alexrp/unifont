This README file describes the development cycle of Hangul font
development using the johab 6/3/1 encoding originally proposed
by Ho-Seok Ee prior to the Unifont 15.1.01 release.

The ordinary development cycle is as follows:

     1) Modify the hangul-base.txt file.
     2) Type "make" in the hangul directory.  The main actions
        of this will be:

        a) Regenerate the hangul-base.hex file from the modified
           hangul-base.txt file.
        b) Create a new hangul-syllables.hex file, containing
           the modern Unicode Hangul Syllables block of 11,172
           glyphs.
        c) Create the hangul-base.html file, showing how the
           three components of a Hangul syllable fit with
           each other in an HTML page viewable with a web
           browser.  Overlaps between initial consonants
           (choseong) and medial vowels and diphthongs
           (jungseong), if any, are listed at the end of the
           HTML file.  From this, the font designer can see
           how letters overlap and whether the result is
           acceptable.
        d) Run a "make check" command.  This examines the
           newly-created hangul-base.html file and outputs
           the number of cells that had overlaps among the
           input Hangul letters (jamo).  Overlaps are not
           an error; they are a design tradeoff.  Therefore,
           this step never causes the make file to fail.

     3) View the hangul-base.html file in a web browser.
     4) If further changes are desired, go back to Step 1.

     5) When satisfied, type "make clean" or "make distclean"
        to remove intermediate files created during the source
        compilation and Hangul glyph build.

Examine the Makefile file for more details on its operation.
