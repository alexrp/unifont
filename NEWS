2023-09-12: Release 15.1.01
   * Glyphs updated for Unicode 15.1.0 release.
   * OpenType fonts are now built by default, replacing TrueType fonts.
     TrueType fonts can be built manually by invoking "make truetype"
     in the font directory.
   * New Hangul Johab 6/3/1 encoding devised by Ho-Seok Ee for building
     the Hangul Syllables block (U+AC00..U+D7A3), with new supporting
     programs johab2syllables, unigen-hangul, and unijohab2html.  This
     encoding replaces Unifont's original Hanterm-derived encoding.
     New source files hangul.h and unihangul-support.c provide support
     for rendering syllable bitmaps with all Unicode Hangul letters,
     including all ancient Hangul, through the new unigen-hangul program.
     These functions also can support user-written Hangul syllable rendering
     programs, for example on embedded systems using graphics displays.
   * Added three hexadecimal digit representation CSUR/UCSUR scripts:
     - U+EBE0..U+EBEF: Boby Lapointe's "bibi-binary" notation
     - U+EBF0..U+EBFF: Bruce Alan Martin's bit location notation
     - U+ECF0..U+ECFF: Ronald O. Whitaker's triangular notation.
   * Modified hexdraw to support bitmap manipulation of up to 64 rows
     by 128 columns for 64-by-128 graphics display screen drawing support.
     Added the unihexpose program to transpose Unifont glyphs, for use
     with graphics display controller chips that encode each byte as
     8 rows by 1 column, left to right.
   * Other minor updates; see ChangeLog for details.

2023-06-04: Release 15.0.06
   * Further adjustments to Hangul glyphs in the Basic Multilingual Plane.

2023-06-03: Release 15.0.05
   * New Hangul Syllables block (U+AC00..U+D7A3) contributed
     by Minseo Lee.  Generated with his modifications of three
     combining patterns in the johab2ucs2 Perl script.

2023-05-21: Release 15.0.03
   * Fixed a typo in src/Makefile that could affect
     "make install".
   * Install unifont_all.hex in $(PKGDEST) directory.
   * Other minor changes; see ChangeLog file for details.

2023-05-20: Release 15.0.02
   * N.B.: This is the last planned version to build TrueType
     font files as part of the standard font build with

           make BUILDFONT=1

     In the future, only OpenType font files will be part of
     the ordinary font building using the hex2otf program.
     TrueType fonts will have to be built manually using

           cd font
           make truetype

   * Minor update to allow for separate building of TrueType
     and OpenType fonts.  This is in preparation for the future
     removal of TrueType font files from default font builds,
     in preference for OpenType font files.  That change is
     planned for the release of Unifont 15.1.01, which will
     correspond to the release of the Unicode 15.1.0 standard
     scheduled for September 2023.
   * Added Doxygen annotation to C programs and corresponding
     ".h" header files.  Annotated output is generated in a
     new "doxygen" subdirectory.  Doxygen output consists of
     a browsable set of HTML pages and a hyperlinked PDF document.
   * Updates to make files to fix issues with redundant building
     under some circumstances.
   * Added 196 Plane 2 and Plane 3 Chinese ideographs drawn by
     湖 远星 to the basic Unifont font files for coverage of
     the General Standard Chinese Characters set.  Also added
     biang glyphs drawn by Ming Fan.
   * Fullwidth CJK characters that appeared to be boldface in
     the range U+FF00..U+FFEF were updated using glyphs from
     Wen Quan Yi, with some modifications.

2022-09-13: Release 15.0.01
   * Update for Unicode 15.0.0 release.
   * "make install" now installs Unifont OpenType font files in the
     same directory as TrueType fonts by default.  The intention is
     to remove TrueType fonts file from the "install" target for the
     Unicode 16.0.0 release unless there is a reason to keep them.
   * Existing Unicode scripts in Unifont maintain complete coverage.
   * Under ConScript Unicode Registry (UCSUR) scripts added:
     - U+E1D0..U+E1FF Syai
     - U+E360..U+E37F Sarkai
     - U+ED80..U+EDAF Iranic.
   * New Unicode 15.0.0 Plane 1 scripts:
     - U+10EFD..U+10EFF Arabic Extended-C
     - U+11B00..U+11B5F Devanagari Extended-A
     - U+11F00..U+11F5F Kawi
     - U+1D2C0..U+1D2DF Kaktovik Numerals

   * Fix to font/ttfsrc/Makefile for TrueType & OpenType parallel builds.
   * Minor updates for some glyphs, notably Runic (U+16A0..U+16FF).
   * All Ahom glyphs (U+11700..U+1174F) are now rendered properly.

2022-04-17: Release 14.0.03
   * Added new program hex2otf by 何志翔 (He Zhixiang) to produce
     OpenType Unifont files.
   * Added several Under ConScript Unicode Registry (UCSUR) scripts:
     - U+E2D0..U+E2FF    Xaîni
     - U+E5E0..U+E5FF    Ophidian
     - U+ED40..U+ED5F    Niji
     - U+F1900..U+F19FF  Sitelen Pon
     - U+F1B00..U+F1C3F  Shidinn

   * Adjustments of several other glyphs; details in ChangeLog file.

2020-11-21: Release 13.0.04
   * Font glyphs are now dual-licensed under the SIL Open Font
     License version 1.1, in addition to the GNU GPL version 2+
     with the GNU Font Embedding Exception.
   * Many glyphs in these ranges were re-aligned so the dominant
     horizontal line would be positioned in row 7, counting from
     the bottom.  Some glyphs were redrawn.
     - U+2190..U+21FF Arrows
     - U+2200..U+23FF Mathematical Operators
     - U+2400..U+24FF Miscellaneous Technical
     - U+25A0..U+25FF Geometric Shapes
     - APL operators such as the tacks and jot were not modified,
       so as not to alter alignments of glyphs that APL superimposes
       on each other.
   * U+2200..U+23FF Mathematical Operators: redrew slashes for
     negated operators from vertical lines to slanted lines.
   * Added three new Under ConScript Unicode Registry (UCSUR) Scripts:
     - U+EB40..U+EB5F Standard Galactic
     - U+EB60..U+EB9F Braille Extended
     - U+EBA0..U+EBDF Cistercian Numerals
   * Other changes listed in the ChangeLog file.

2020-07-03: Release 13.0.03
   * Redrawn glyphs for all of Thaana, two updated Tamil glyphs,
     and some Canadian Aboriginal glyphs (David Corbett).
   * Updated unifont.5 man page.
   * Bug fix in font/Makefile for parallel building.
   * Other changes listed in the ChangeLog file.

2020-04-25: Release 13.0.02
   * Glyph blocks replaced:
     - U+3040..U+309F (Hiragana) and U+30A0..U+30FF (Katakana):
       glyphs in unifont_jp replaced with glyphs from the public
       domain izmb16.bdf font.
     - U+FF61..U+FF64 (Halfwidth CKJ Punctuation) and U+FF65..U+FF9F
       (Halfwidth Katakana Variations): glyphs in unifont and unifont_jp
       replaced with glyphs from the public domain single-byte FONTX2
       font DFLHN16.FNT.
   * Minor patches to several glyphs.
   * See ChangeLog for details.

2020-03-28: Release 13.0.01

   * Adds several new scripts:
     - U+10E80..U+10EBF Yezidi (Johnnie Weaver)
     - U+10FB0..U+10FDF Chorasmian (Johnnie Weaver)
     - U+11900..U+1195F Dives Akuru (David Corbett)
     - U+11FB0          Lisu Supplement (Paul Hardy)
     - U+18B00..U+18CFF Khitan Small Script (Johnnie Weaver)
     - U+1FB00..U+1FBFF Symbols for Legacy Computing (Rebecca Bettencourt).

   * Minor patches to several glyphs.
   * Some improvements to font/Makefile.
   * See ChangeLog for details.

2019-08-11: Release 12.1.03
   * Replaces the public domain Jiskan Japanese glyphs in
     unifont_jp with the improved Izumi Japanese glyphs,
     which (like Jiskan) are also from a font in the public
     domain spanning JIS X 0213 Plane 1 and Plane 2.

   * Improved glyphs for Limbu, Buginese, Tai Tham, Adlam,
     and Mayan Numerals.

2019-06-01: Release 12.1.02
   * Adds a Japanese version of Unifont, unifont_jp, containing
     kanji glyphs from the public domain Jiskan16 font.

   * Contains redrawn Devanagari and Bengali glyphs with
     narrower consonants for better superimposing of vowels.

     Unicode 12.1.0.

   * Elizabeth Bettencourt contributed many Under ConScript Unicode
     Registry (UCSUR) scripts for the Plane 0 Private Use Area.

   * Some adjustments were made to Nandinagari and Nyiakeng Puachue
     Hmong scripts.  Full details are in the ChangeLog file.

   * Minor changes to source code, mainly to suppress warnings
     on more systems.

2019-03-05: Release 12.0.01
   This release adds changes in Unicode Standard version 12.0.0,
   maintaining complete coverage of Unicode Plane 0, and adding
   the 11,000th Plane 1 glyph.  Major additions are as follows:

   *  New scripts in Unicode 12.0.0:

      - U+10FE0..U+10FFF Elymaic
      - U+119A0..U+119FF Nandinagari
      - U+11FC0..U+11FFF Tamil Supplement
      - U+13430..U+1343F Egyptian Hieroglyph Format Controls
      - U+1B130..U+1B16F Small Kana Extension
      - U+1E100..U+1E14F Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong
      - U+1E2C0..U+1E2FF Wancho
      - U+1ED00..U+1ED4F Ottoman Siyaq Numbers
      - U+1FA70..U+1FAFF Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A

   * U+1FA00..U+1FA5F Chess Symbols: 84 new glyphs added in Unicode 12.0.0.

   * Two new programs:

      - unibmpbump, by Paul Hardy, to shift glyphs created by
        unihex2png but later converted to .bmp image files,
        to allow processing by unibmp2hex.

      - unihexrotate, by David Corbett, to rotate glyphs in
        Unifont .hex files by any desired number of quarter turns
        clockwise or counterclockwise.

   Full details are in the ChangeLog file.

2018-12-08: Release 11.0.03
   This release contains two significant contributions in the Unicode
   Supplementary Multilingual Plane (Plane 1):

     - Nushu glyphs (U+16FE1 and U+1B170..U+1B2FB) from David Corbett.

     - Kana Supplement glyphs (U+1B000..U+1B0FF) and Kana Extended-A
       glyphs (U+1B100..U+1B12F) from Johnnie Weaver.

2018-08-10: Release 11.0.02
   Adds Sutton SignWriting glyphs.  Miscellaneous patches to other glyphs.

2018-06-05: Release 11.0.01
   Update for Unicode 11.0.0 release.  Modifications maintain complete
   coverage of the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).  Also includes
   many Supplemental Multilingual Plane (SMP) scripts added in Unicode 11.0.

   Notable in this release is the Unicode 11.0 addition of the Copyleft
   symbol at code point U+01F12F.  Because of its significance, this is
   the only SMP glyph added to the Unicode TrueType BMP font.  This glyph
   also appears in the Unicode Upper TrueType font.  BDF and PCF fonts
   do not contain this symbol, as they only allow code points below U+10000.

2017-12-27: Release 10.0.07
   Changes to allow cross-building from source.  Now the top-level Makefile
   and src/Makefile define INSTALL=install, rather than install C programs
   with the "-s" (strip) option.  This is part of a change requested by
   Helmut Grohne to allow cross-architecture building without invoking
   an architecture-specific "install -s".  However, INSTALL still can
   be defined on the top-level command line when make is invoked as
   INSTALL="install -s" to allow stripping C binaries during installation
   if desired.  This definition from the top-level Makefile is passed down
   to src/Makefile, which uses any command line definition when installing
   C programs.  Plain "install" is still used when installing Perl
   programs.

   Minor adjustments to glyphs as noted in the ChangeLog file.

2017-08-27: Release 10.0.06

   Added numerous improvements to Unicode Plane 0 and Plane 1 scripts,
   almost all of which were contributed by David Corbett; see the
   ChangeLog file for details.

   Made changes to make files contributed by Mike Gilbert to support
   parallel make.

   Fixed a corrupted ASCII hexadecimal string array in unifontpic.h.

2017-07-12: Release 10.0.05

   This release positions Unicode double diacritic marks correctly
   in the TrueType fonts.  The previous release did not multiply
   their offsets by the correct scale factor in FontForge.

   The unifontpic chart title is also centered along the top row
   legend, which looks better visually.

   The Phonetic Extensions block has gone through major revision,
   with minor adjustments in other Unicode scripts as described
   in the ChangeLog file.

2017-07-08: Release 10.0.04

   Added "-P" flag to the unifontpic utility to specify the Unicode
   plane.  This allows creating code charts for glyphs above Plane 0.
   The Unicode plane is now added to the chart title.  This works
   properly for the wide and the long chart versions, with the
   letters in the long version's chart title now single-spaced.

   Received double-width Chinese ideographs to replace the quadruple-
   width glyphs for Church Slavonic transliteration that were released
   in Unifont 10.0.01.  This allows a return to PNG charts of Unifont
   glyphs.  PNG files are smaller than the BMP version but the PNG
   Unifont utilities have not been modified to handle quadruple-width
   glyphs, whereas the BMP utilities have been.  The 18 quadruple-width
   Chinese glyphs are preserved in font/plane00/alt/quad-width.hex to
   allow future experimentation.

   The PNG charts of Unicode Plane 1 (Supplemental Multilingual Plane)
   glyphs now use the Unifont "sample" version of Unifont ".hex" files,
   so that combining circles appear.  This was already being done for
   Unicode Plane 0 and will look better in font sample pages.

   Added new x-offset field to all *-combining.txt files to provide
   proper rendering of Unicode double diacritic marks; they should
   span across the preceding character and the following character.
   Added support for this in hex2sfd for FontForge generation of
   TrueType fonts.  Also added support for this to the unigencircles
   utility, so the combining circle of a double diacritic is printed
   correctly in the left half of the glyph as in the Unicode
   Consortium's code charts, rather than being centered.  Several
   applications are not rendering these double diacritic marks
   correctly; releasing this version of Unifont will allow validation
   of the new Unifont TrueType build, and could serve as a test font
   for implementing these specialty Unicode characters in other
   applications.

   Redrew Musical Symbols Ornaments (U+01D194..U+01D1A5) so they
   join together when used as a consecutive string of characters.
   Adjusted the Byzantine Musical Symbols "ano", "meso", and "kato"
   glyph versions for high, middle, and low vertical placement,
   respectively.

   Made numerous adjustments to many glyphs as noted in the ChangeLog
   file, including re-coding some "subjoiner" glyphs as combining
   characters instead of as non-printing.  Those glyphs now render
   a virama (halant) sign if a script contains such a sign, or a
   "+" subscript sign otherwise.

2017-06-30: Release 10.0.03

   Modified font/hex2sfd to reposition combining characters.  If
   you experience problems with the TrueType font in this release,
   revert to 10.0.02.

2017-06-30: Release 10.0.02

   Touched up glyphs in the block U+03xx, which includes modern Greek.
   Fixed an Aiha glyph in the Private Use Area in the Unifont CSUR font.

2017-06-20: Release 10.0.01

   Updated for Unicode 10.0 release.

   New scripts added (introduced in Unicode 10.0):
     - U+0860..U+086F     Syriac Supplement
     - U+011A00..U+011A4F Zanabazar Square
     - U+011A50..U+011AAF Soyombo
     - U+011D00..U+011D5F Masaram Gondi

   Added quadruple-width glyphs U+9FD8..U+9FE9, updating some utility
   programs and documentation to allow this change.  The Perl scripts
   unihex2png, unipng2hex, and unifont-viewer do not support this new
   16-by-32 glyph size.

   Corrected several glyphs and made numerous changes in others,
   described in detail in the ChangeLog file.

2016-12-22: Release 9.0.06

   Refined about 50 Pikto CSUR glyphs.

   Corrected two Osage glyphs and one mathematical operator as noted
   in ChangeLog.

2016-12-10: Release 9.0.05

   Modified Cherokee glyphs to reflect changes in recent Cherokee font
   that the Unicode Consortium adopted for its code charts.  Removed
   serifs to make Cherokee glyphs easier to read.

   Modified Pikto CSUR glyphs after comparison with high-resolution scans
   of Basic Pikto book.

2016-10-29: Release 9.0.04

   Extended "{" and "}" by one pixel so they now come to a point in the center.
   Swapped U+2A05 and U+2A06 so they are now in the correct order.

2016-10-21: Release 9.0.03

   Added CSUR glyphs:
     - Aiha: added doubling combining glyph, omitted from the ConScript
       Unicode Registry (CSUR) code chart.
     - Tonal System: base 16 counting system devised by John William Nystrom
       in the mid-19th century.
     - Pikto: added the Pikto glyphs to Plane 15 Private Use Area, in the
       range specified in the CSUR.

   The giant picture of all of Plane 0 now includes the Plane 0 CSUR glyphs,
   although those are an optional part of Unifont in separate font files.

2016-08-27: Release 9.0.02

   Added 3 more CSUR scripts.  Modifications to some existing glyphs.

2016-07-02: Release 9.0.01

   Updates to support Unicode 9.0.0.

2015-06-28: Release 8.0.01

  Updates to support Unicode 8.0.0.

2014-10-23: Release 7.0.06

   A few new scripts were added:
      U+010350..U+01037F Old Permic
      U+01F650..U+01F67F Ornamental Dingbats
      U+01F780..U+01F7FF Geometrical Shapes Extended
      U+01F800..U+01F8FF Supplemental Arrows-C

   Various changes were made to Makefiles, Perl scripts, and one bash
   shell script to conform to Debian Policy Manual version 3.9.6.

   Several changes were made to Makefiles:
      * Use "set -e" at the start of multi-command shell invocations,
        to trap errors.
      * Use "&&" rather than ";" in multi-command shell invocations,
        to fail on errors.
      * install now uses "-s" flag for C program binaries.

   Other minor changes were made to scripts; see ChangeLog
   for details.

2014-10-17: Release 7.0.05

   Modified ASCII letter 'l' so it would have the same height as
   the other lower-case letters with ascenders; this is one pixel
   taller than the capital letters.  Lowered the horizontal stroke 
   in 't' by one pixel so it would line up with the horizontal
   stroke in 'f'; this is one pixel lower than the x-height of
   the ASCII letters.  Letters elsewhere in Plane 0 that were formed
   with 'k', 'l', or 't' were checked and modified where appropriate
   to conform with the new ASCII glyphs.

   Completed the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs script in Plane 1,
   and modified Plane 1 Emoticons and Transport and Map Symbols scripts.

   Now create file font/compiled/plane01.html, showing a color-coded
   indication of completion of all of Unicode Plane 1 as an HTML
   table in a self-contained HTML file.  That and the compiled/index.html
   are the two HTML files that building the font creates.  The plane01.html
   file gives a color coding to show completion of each 256-glyph block,
   from 0% (pure red) to 100% (pure green).

2014-10-11: Release 7.0.04

   Added five more Supplemental Multilingual Plane (Plane 1) scripts
   and improved others thanks to several contributors.  There are now
   over 5,000 drawn assigned glyphs for Plane 1!

   Reorganized font/plane01 directory.  Several other changes; see
   ChangeLog file for details.

   unihex2sfd and unipagecount now handle all Unicode planes, not just
   Plane 0.


2014-07-01: Release 7.0.03

   Minor release for Debian.  Added a man page for unihexfill(1);
   Debian requires a man page for each program.

2014-06-22: Release 7.0.02

   Fixes a bug in font/Makefile: there were two "done" statements at the
   end of one "for" loop.  Also adds many new Supplemental Multilingual
   Plane (Plane 1) scripts.  See the ChangeLog file for details.

2014-06-21: Release 7.0.01

   Provides a glyph for every visible code point in the Unicode 7.0 Basic
   Mulitlingual Plane.  Also adds more scripts in the Unicode 7.0
   Supplemental Multilingual Plane.  See the ChangeLog file for full
   details.

   Note that the versioning scheme has changed.  Instead of a date, this
   package will use an incrementing minor version number in the future
   ("01", "02", etc.).

2014-02-14: Release 6.3.20140214

   This version adds the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 to the "COPYING"
   file.

2014-02-04: Release 6.3.20140204

   This version added Qianqian Fang's name to the COPYRIGHT string now
   passed to Fontforge when the TTF fonts are built, for his contributions
   contained in the file "font/plane00/wqy.hex".

   This version also removes "<img>" links to icons on external websites from
   the "hangul/hangul-generation.html" web page, which were retrieved and
   stored locally when the original web page was saved in the "hangul/"
   directory.

2014-02-02: Release 6.3.20140202

   This version is the first designed to easily build multiple fonts.
   To accomplish this, font/Makefile and font/ttfsrc/Makefile were
   modified to pass FONT and COMBINING parameters, giving the names
   of the font file and its associated combining.txt file.

   This version introduces a subset of Unicode's Supplemental Multilingual
   Plane (SMP, or Plane 1).  The file "font/plane01/plane01.hex" contains
   a glyph for every visible code point in the Unicode 5.0 SMP except
   "Cuneiform" and "Cuneiform Numbers and Punctuation"; those two scripts
   require more resolution than what will fit within a 16 by 16 pixel grid.
   Andrew Miller drew well over 1,000 glyphs for this effort, and added
   glyphs for several SMP scripts introduced after Unicode 5.0.

   This version also introduces a subset of the ConScript Unicode
   Registry (CSUR) Private Use Area glyphs.  Wojciech Stryjewski created
   glyphs for Tengwar and Klingon -- Tolkien fans and Trekkies rejoice!
   Paul Hardy drew Cirth to finish the Tolkien set, and drew other scripts.
   Andrew Miller made very extensive additions for the CSUR; see the
   ChangeLog for details.

   Finally, this version includes a special PSF font for using APL
   in console mode on GNU/Linux.  This PSF font contains 512 glyphs
   as a subset of Unifont; it will not work on systems that only
   support PSF fonts with 256 glyphs.  This PSF font will support
   GNU APL and several other APL implementations.

   The names of the font files are as follows:

      unifont-*               Font with Unifont Plane 0 glyphs

      unifont_sample-*        Font with Unifont glyphs, with combining
                              circles added for illustration

      unifont_csur-*          Font with glyphs from Unifont plus the
                              CSUR PUA glyphs

      unifont_upper-*         Font with glyphs from Planes 1 through 14

      unifont_upper_csur-*    Font with glyphs from Planes 1 through 15

      Unifont-APL8x16.psf.gz  The APL console font

Glyphs for code points U+FFFE and U+FFFF, previously added for illustration
purposes in unifont_sample, were removed because they caused problems on
Microsoft Windows XP.  These glyphs are still included in the large bitmap
graphic of Unifont but are no longer in the font itself.

Many other small changes were made as noted in the ChangeLog file, but
support for glyphs beyond Unicode's Basic Multilingual Plane is the most
notable change.

2013-12-21: Release 6.3.2013121

   The default font name that hex2bdf creates has changed from
   lower-case "unifont" to "Unifont".

   FontForge's SetFontNames function calls were removed because
   not all applications correctly interpreted their settings.
   For example, LibreOffice only listed Unifont by the foundry
   name ("GNU") rather than foundry + font name ("GNU Unifont")
   or just the font name.  Those calls are only commented out
   so they could easily be re-introduced.

   Some glyphs were changed for better appearance with APL.

2013-12-17: Release 6.3.20131217

   This fixes three bugs:

        * doc/Makefile: removed redirection of texi2pdf output.
        * font/Makefile: don't modify PCF fonts with FontForge,
          which alters them so grub-mkfont can't read them.
        * font/ttfsrc/Makefile: remove *.bdf so unifont_sample.bdf
          gets deleted.

   Also includes a few formatting changes; see ChangeLog.

2013-12-15: Release 6.3.20131215

   This version introduces unihex2png and unipng2hex, two Perl scripts
   that Andrew Miller wrote based upon Paul Hardy's unihex2bmp.c and
   unibmp2hex.c programs.  These new scripts allow conversion between
   the Unifont .hex format and Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files
   for graphical editing.  With this addition, more graphics programs
   can be used to edit Unifont glyphs.

   unihex2png and unipng2hex also support glyphs that are 24 or 32
   pixels tall, in addition to Unifont's default 16 pixels tall.
   Roman Czyborra's hexdraw and hex2bdf Perl scripts were modified
   to also support glyphs that are 16, 24, or 32 pixels tall.  These
   changes have not been fully tested, and at this point are considered
   experimental.

   There are no plans to add this multi-height support to unihex2bmp.c
   and  unibmp2hex.c.

   The package now contains a "doc/" directory, with documentation
   in Texinfo format.  Files in the "man/" directory were updated
   for consistency, especially in noting that all programs are
   covered under GPLv2+ now.

   In addition to "unifont-*.*" font files, this package now also creates
   "unifont_sample-*.*" files.  These "Unifont Sample" fonts contain
   combining circles, and four-digit hexadecimal glyphs for unassigned
   code points and Private Use Area glyphs.  Because of the inclusion
   of combining cirlces, "Unifont Sample" font versions are only intended
   for illustrating individual glyphs, not for general-purpose writing.
   The two generated fonts are unifont_sample-*.bdf and unifont_sample-*.ttf.
   The TTF file contains SBIT glyphs, not outlined TrueType glyphs like
   "unifont-*.ttf".

   The font versions (BDF, PCF, and TTF) now contain copyright and
   version information.  This will help identify outdated versions
   of a font in the future.  hex2bdf now accepts a version string and
   a copyright string as command line arguments.

   To simplify this package supporting two versions of Unifont
   ("Unifont" and "Unifont Sample"), hex2bdf now accepts a font name
   as a command line argument.  This will streamline adding additional
   fonts in the future as part of this same package.  Note that the
   old XLFD font name "unifont" has now been capitalized to "Unifont".

   Many XLFD properties have been added to the BDF version of Unifont
   in addition to font version and copyright XLFD properties.  At least
   some of these are carried over to the PCF version during conversion
   with bdftopcf.  This has solved an issue with grub-mkfont and FreeType
   for converting the PCF font into a GRUB version.

   Some glyphs were redrawn: the Capricorn sign, several CJK Radicals
   Supplement ideographs, and several Armenian letters.  The Armenian
   letters were modified with the new unihex2png and unipng2hex programs.

   Further details are in the ChangeLog file.

2013-10-20: Release 6.3.20131020

   This is the first release as part of the GNU Project.
