Unifont is the creation of Roman Czyborra, who created Perl utilities for generating a dual-\/width Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) font 16 pixels tall, unifont.\+bdf, from an input file named unifont.\+hex. The unifont.\+hex file contained two fields separated by a colon\+: a Unicode code point as four hexadecimal digits, and a hexadecimal string of 32 or 64 characters representing the glyph bitmap pattern. Roman also wrote other Perl scripts for manipulating unifont.\+hex files.

Jungshik Shin wrote a Perl script, johab2ucs2, to convert Hangul syllable glyph elements into Hangul Johab-\/encoded fonts. These glyph elements are compatible with Jaekyung \char`\"{}\+Jake\char`\"{} Song\textquotesingle{}s Hanterm terminal emulator. Paul Hardy modified johab2ucs2 and drew Hangul Syllables Unicode elements for compatibility with this Johab encoding and with Hanterm. These new glyphs were created to avoid licensing issues with the Hangul Syllables glyphs that were in the original unifont.\+hex file.

Over time, Unifont was extended to allow correct positioning of combining marks in a True\+Type font, coverage beyond Unicode Plane 0, and the addition of Under-\/\+Con\+Script Unicode Registry (UCSUR) glyphs. There is also partial support for experimental quadruple-\/width glyphs.

Paul Hardy wrote the first pair of C programs, \mbox{\hyperlink{unihex2bmp_8c}{unihex2bmp.\+c}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{unibmp2hex_8c}{unibmp2hex.\+c}}, to facilitate editing the bitmaps at their real aspect ratio. These programs allow conversion between the Unifont .hex format and a Windows Bitmap or Wireless Bitmap file for editing with a graphics editor. This was followed by make files, other C programs, Perl scripts, and shell scripts.

Luis Alejandro González Miranda wrote scripts for converting unifont.\+hex into a True\+Type font using Font\+Forge.

Andrew Miller wrote additional Perl programs for directly rendering unifont.\+hex files, for converting unifont.\+hex to and from Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files for editing based upon Paul Hardy\textquotesingle{}s BMP conversion programs, and also wrote other Perl scripts.

David Corbett wrote a Perl script to rotate glyphs in a unifont.\+hex file and an awk script to substitute new glyphs for old glyphs of the same Unicode code point in a unifont.\+hex file.

何志翔 (He Zhixiang) wrote a program to convert Unifont files into Open\+Type fonts, \mbox{\hyperlink{hex2otf_8c}{hex2otf.\+c}}.

Minseo Lee created new Hangul glyphs for the original Unifont Johab 10/3 or 4/4 encoding. This was followed immediately after by Ho-\/\+Seok Ee, who created Hangul glyphs for a new, simpler Johab 6/3/1 encoding that are now in Unifont.\hypertarget{index_Programs}{}\doxysection{The C Programs}\label{index_Programs}
This documentation only covers C programs and their header files. These programs are typically longer than the Unifont package\textquotesingle{}s Perl scripts, which being much smaller are easier to understand. The C programs are, in alphabetical order\+:

The very first program written for Unifont conversion was Roman Czyborra\textquotesingle{}s hexdraw Perl script. That one script would convert a unifont.\+hex file into a text file with 16 lines per glyph (one for each glyph row) followed by a blank line aftr each glyph. That allowed editing unifont.\+hex glyphs with a text-\/based editor.

Combined with Roman\textquotesingle{}s hex2bdf Perl script to convert a unifont.\+hex file into a BDF font, these two scripts formed a complete package for editing Unifont and generating the resulting BDF fonts.

There was no combining mark support initially, and the original unifont.\+hex file included combining circles with combining mark glyphs.

The list below gives a brief description of these and the other Perl scripts that are in the Unifont package src subdirectory.
