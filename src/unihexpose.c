   @file: unihetranspose.c

   @brief: Transpose Unifont glyph bitmaps.

   This program takes Unifont .hex format glyphs and converts those
   glyphs so that each byte (two hexadecimal digits in the .hex file)
   represents a column of 8 rows.  This simplifies use with graphics
   display controllers that write lines consisting of 8 rows at a time
   to a display.

   The bytes are ordered as first all the columns for the glyph in
   the first 8 rows, then all the columns in the next 8 rows, with
   columns ordered from left to right.

   This file must be linked with functions in unifont-support.c.
