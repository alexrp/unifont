/**
   @brief Transpose a Unifont .hex format glyph into 2 column-major sub-arrays.

   This function takes a 16-by-16 cell bit array made from a Unifont
   glyph (as created by the glyph2bits function) and outputs a transposed
   array of 2 sets of 8 or 16 columns, depending on the glyph width.
   This format simplifies outputting these bit patterns on a graphics
   display with a controller chip designed to output a column of 8 pixels
   at a time.

   For a line of text with Unifont output, first all glyphs can have
   their first 8 rows of pixels displayed on a line.  Then the second
   8 rows of all glyphs on the line can be displayed.  This simplifies
   code for such controller chips that are designed to automatically
   increment input bytes of column data by one column at a time for
   each successive byte.

   The glyphbits array contains a '1' in each cell where the corresponding
   non-transposed glyph has a pixel set, and 0 in each cell where a pixel
   is not set.

   @param[in] width The number of columns in the glyph.
   @param[in] glyphbits The 16-by-16 pixel glyph bits.
   @param[out] transpose The array of 2 sets of 8 ot 16 columns of 8 pixels.
