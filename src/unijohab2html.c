   @brief Display overalpped Hangul letter combinations in a grid.

   This displays overlapped letters that form Unicode Hangul Syllables
   combinations, as a tool to determine bounding boxes for all combinations.
   It works with both modern and archaic Hangul letters.

   Input is a Unifont .hex file such as the "hangul-base.hex" file that
   is part of the Unifont package.  Glyphs are all processed as being
   16 pixels wide and 16 pixels tall.

   Output is an HTML file containing 16 by 16 pixel grids shwoing
   overlaps in table format, arranged by variation of the initial
   consonant (choseong).

   Initial consonants (choseong) have 6 variations.  In general, the
   first three are for combining with vowels (jungseong) that are
   vertical, horizontal, or vertical and horizontal, respectively;
   the second set of three variations are for combinations with a final
   consonant.

   The output HTML file can be viewed in a web browser.
