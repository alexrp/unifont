.TH UNIFONTPIC 1 "2013 Sep 07"
.SH NAME
unifontpic \- Convert GNU Unifont .hex input to a bitmap image of the whole font
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunifontpic \fP[\-d\fInnn\fP] [\-l] [\-t] [\-P\fIplane\fP] < \fIinput-font.hex \fP> \fIoutput-font.bmp\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unifontpic
reads a GNU Unifont .hex file from STDIN and writes a two dimensional
rendering for each glyph to STDOUT.
The output displays an entire Unicode plane of 65,536 glyphs
as one large graphic image, showing a grid of 256 glyphs by 256 glyphs
as the default, or (at your option) a long version of
16 glyphs across by 4,096 glyphs down.
.PP
Input can be one or more files in Unifont .hex format.  They don't
have to be sorted, as
.B unifontpic
will populate the entire glyph array of 65,536 code points before
writing its output.  The input glyph code points should all be
unique, as feeding in duplicate code points will produce unpredictable
results.  Use
.B unidup (1)
on a sorted input of .hex files to guarantee no code point
duplication.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.BR \-d
Specify a Dots per Inch (DPI) resolution of
.I nnn.
For example, specifying \-d120 will encode the bitmap graphics file
output as having a resolution of 120 DPI.
.TP
.BR \-l
Produce a long chart, 16 glyphs wide by 4,096 glyphs tall.
The default is a wide chart, 256 glyphs wide by 256 glyphs tall.
.TP
.BR \-t
Use tiny numbers for the row and column code point labels.  Tiny
numbers are on a 4 by 5 pixel grid.  Only tiny code point labels
appear on the long chart variant; this option only has effect
for wide charts (the default, of 256 by 256 glyphs).  If this option
is not specified for the default 256-by-256 grid, row and column
code point labels are taken from Unifont's glyphs for `0' to `9'
and `A' to `F'.
.TP
.BR \-P
Print a chart for Unicode plane number \fIplane\fP.
The default is Plane\ 0, the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
The range of Unicode plane range is 0 through 17, inclusive.
The plane number is printed on the chart title line.
