.TH UNIFONT1PER 1 "2017 Jun 11"
.SH NAME
unifont1per \- Create BMP glyph files from GNU Unifont .hex file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunifont1per \fP< \fIinput_file.hex\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unifont1per
reads a GNU Unifont .hex file and for each code point in the file,
creates an output Bitmapped Graphics (".bmp") file in the current directory.
The filename for each output file is "U+\fIcodepoint\fP.bmp", where
\fIcodepoint\fP is the Unicode codepoint for the glyph.
.PP
Each glyph entry in a Unifont .hex file is expected to be 16 rows tall,
and can be 8, 16, 24, or 32 pixels wide.  The glyph sizes in output files
are determined on a glyph-by-glyph basis.
.PP
This program can be of use in extracting individual glyphs to display
in a document or on a web page.
.PP
.B WARNING!
This program generates one output file per code point that appears
in the input stream.  If you feed this program a file with 1000 code points,
it will generate 1000 files in your current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
